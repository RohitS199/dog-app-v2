# PawCheck Beta Tester Acknowledgment

**Version 1.0 | Effective Date: ________**

Thank you for participating in the PawCheck beta testing program. Before you begin, please read and acknowledge the following.

---

## What PawCheck Is

PawCheck is a mobile application that provides **educational health information** about common dog symptoms. It uses artificial intelligence to suggest a general urgency level and related educational content based on symptoms you describe.

## What PawCheck Is NOT

PawCheck is **not a veterinary service, diagnostic tool, or substitute for professional veterinary care**. The app does not examine, diagnose, or treat animals. All information provided by PawCheck is educational in nature and should never replace the judgment of a licensed veterinarian.

## Your Responsibilities as a Beta Tester

By participating in this beta test, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

1. **Not Medical Advice.** You understand that PawCheck provides educational information only. You will **not** rely on PawCheck as a substitute for professional veterinary examination, diagnosis, or treatment.

2. **Seek Veterinary Care.** If your dog is experiencing a health concern, you will contact your veterinarian or an emergency veterinary clinic regardless of what PawCheck displays.

3. **Report Dangerous Results.** If PawCheck returns a result that you believe is dangerous, misleading, or could cause a pet owner to delay seeking necessary veterinary care, you agree to report it promptly to the PawCheck development team at: **[CONTACT EMAIL]**

4. **Beta Software.** You understand that PawCheck is pre-release software undergoing active testing. It may contain errors, produce incorrect urgency classifications, or behave unexpectedly. Features may change or be removed without notice.

5. **No Guarantee of Accuracy.** The urgency levels (Emergency, Urgent, Soon, Low Urgency) and educational content generated by PawCheck are AI-generated approximations. They may be incorrect for your dog's specific situation, breed, age, or medical history.

6. **Data Collection.** During the beta period, anonymized usage data (symptom categories, urgency classifications, response times) may be collected to improve the service. No personally identifiable health information about you or your pet will be shared with third parties.

7. **Confidentiality.** You agree not to publicly distribute, screenshot for public posting, or otherwise share PawCheck beta builds with individuals outside the approved beta testing group.

## Emergency Situations

**If you believe your dog is experiencing a medical emergency, contact your veterinarian or an emergency animal hospital immediately.** Do not wait for PawCheck to respond. In case of suspected poisoning, contact the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center at **(888) 426-4435**.
